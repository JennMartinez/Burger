# Barnyard Burger

This is an assignment that utilizes **MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** with a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.

**Heroku** is used to deploy the **Barnyard Burger App.**

Once deployed, the app will display three boxes that will display the options for the user to interact with Barnyard Burger. 

The first box is titled, **"Burger Menu."**

        - This menu box will display the seven available burgers that the restaurant has          to offer the user. The burgers are stored in MySQL database.
        
        - Next to each burger there is a button that states, "Inhale." Once the user clicks the "Inhale" button, that specific burger will move to the second box entitled, "Inhaled Burgers."

The second box is titled, **"Inhaled Burgers."**

        - This box will display in list form the inhaled burgers that were submitted by the "Inhale" button from the Burger Menu.

The third box is titled, **"Burger Orders."**
